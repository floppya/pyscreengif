screengif
========

screengif is a tool for taking animated screenshots.

Requirements
============
screengif is based on [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).
I've only tested this in win7 but it ought to work wherever PyQt works.
It also has a dependency on [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/).

Usage
=====
* Run the 'start.bat', 'start.sh', or 'src/main.py' depending on
your system
* Select a region on your desktop by holding left-click and dragging
* Adjust fps, output size, and location as you'd like.
* Click record
* When you're done recording, click the 'stop recording' button
format of your choosing
